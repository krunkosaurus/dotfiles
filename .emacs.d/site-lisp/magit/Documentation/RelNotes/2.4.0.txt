It's Magit!  A Git Porcelain inside Emacs
=========================================

Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

Magit v2.4.0 Release Notes
==========================

UNRELEASED.

Changes since v2.3.0
--------------------

* When Git is run for side-effects and exits with a non-zero status,
  then the respective error message is now inserted into the status
  buffer.  This should help those users who do not see that message
  when it is being displayed in the echo area.

* Popups gained support for a new event type `:variable', which can be
  used to change the value of Git variables.  This can only be used in
  combination with Magit (just `magit-popup.el' by itself is not
  sufficient).  #2409

* The backward-compatibility kludge `magit-branch-manager' has been
  removed.  The one and only binding to show the refs buffer now is
  "y"; the "b v" binding has been removed.

* The command `with-editor-finish' now runs the new hook
  `with-editor-post-finish-hook'.

* It is now possible to revert file-visiting buffers both silently and
  asynchronously at the same time (by setting `magit-revert-buffers' to
  a negative number).

* The command `magit-diff-visit-file' now runs the new hook
  `magit-diff-visit-file-hook'.

* When the upstream branch or push remote is configured but the
  respective branch does not actually exist, then that is now reported
  in the header of the status buffer.  #2390

* The header line about the upstream branch in the status buffer, is
  now prefixed with either "Merge" or "Rebase", depending on the value
  of `branch.<current-branch>.rebase'. #2390

* `magit-define-popup' learned two new arguments `:setup-function' and
  `:refresh-function'.  These arguments should be used instead of the
  MODE argument, which is now deprecated.  #2389

* Negative text properties are no longer faked, that was just too ugly
  and inefficient.  Since v2.1.0 Magit no longer sets the background
  color for any faces except for those related to diffs.  Third-party
  themes which still set the background color of non-diff faces, have
  to be adjusted, because the background color of these faces would be
  shadowed by the highlighting of the current section.  This does not
  apply to diff-related faces because diff sections are highlighted
  differently from other sections.  #2387

This release also contains the changes described in the v2.3.1 release
notes, as well as various other documentation fixes, code clean-ups,
bug fixes, and other small to medium improvements.
